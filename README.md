# Car Rental System

## Pricing Scenarios

In our rental car system, we ensure customers are charged the most favorable rate. For example, if the hourly rental cost exceeds the daily rate for a given rental period, we charge the customer the daily rate instead of the hourly rate.

**Example:**
- Tesla rental: $10/hour, $50/day
- If rented for 6 hours, hourly cost = $60
- Since $60 exceeds the daily rate of $50, the customer is charged $50

This logic ensures fairness and transparency in our pricing model.
